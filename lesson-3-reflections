When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when we work with other people on the project or when we work for a different computer
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks allow you to get file from github repository in your repository directly,
	clone allow to get file from github repository to your local repository,
	branches allow you to create another "version" of the project even with keeping the original plain 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	In this way you can eventually avoid conflict with your and other's code, also avoid to make two time the same work
