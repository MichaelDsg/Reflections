When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	when we work with other people on the project or when we work for a different computer
  
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	because in this way we can choose what and if to pull in our local repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	forks allow you to get file from github repository in your repository directly,
	clone allow to get file from github repository to your local repository,
	branches allow you to create another "version" of the project even with keeping the original plain 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	In this way you can eventually avoid conflict with your and other's code, also avoid to make two time the same work

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

	is absolutely better to work using git and github, for keep track of your changes and for collaborate with others.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	for example is a good idea when you collaborate to other, in that way you can make each other the changes and than merge your idea in a new 
	code without modify the master branch untill when you choose which is the best solution
